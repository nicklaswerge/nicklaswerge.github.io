I am a postdoc in the Data Science and Statistics ([DSS](https://dss.sdu.dk)) Group at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science ([IMADA](https://www.sdu.dk/en/om_sdu/institutter_centre/imada_matematik_og_datalogi)), University of Southern Denmark ([SDU](https://www.sdu.dk/en)).
I did my Ph.D. at the Laboratory for Probability, Statistics, and Modeling ([LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris)), Sorbonne Universit√©, under the supervision of [Antoine Godichon-Baggioni](http://godichon.perso.math.cnrs.fr) and [Olivier Wintenberger](http://wintenberger.fr). During the first year of my Ph.D., I also worked part-time at [Advestis](https://www.advestis.com) as an AI Research Scientist.

## Research interest
I am interested in machine learning and statistics for time series, especially online learning and stochastic algorithms.
