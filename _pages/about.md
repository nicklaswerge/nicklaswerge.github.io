I am a Ph.D. student at the Laboratory for Probability, Statistics and Modeling ([LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris "LPSM")), Sorbonne University, where I am supervised by [Antoine Godichon-Baggioni](http://godichon.perso.math.cnrs.fr) and [Olivier Wintenberger](http://wintenberger.fr).

## Research interest
I am interested in statistical machine learning, and especially in online learning and stochastic optimization.
