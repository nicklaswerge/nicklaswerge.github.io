I am a Ph.D. student at the Laboratory for Probability, Statistics and Modeling ([LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris "LPSM")), Sorbonne University, under the supervision of [Antoine Godichon-Baggioni](http://godichon.perso.math.cnrs.fr) and [Olivier Wintenberger](http://wintenberger.fr). During the first year of my Ph.D., I worked part-time at [Advestis](https://www.advestis.com) as an AI Research Scientist. I received my master's degree in mathematics-economics at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/) in 2016, with Olivier Wintenberger as my supervisor. After my master's, I was at [Nordea Asset Management](https://www.nordeaassetmanagement.com) for three years as a quantitative analyst.

## Research interest
I am interested in machine learning and statistics for time series, especially online learning and stochastic algorithms.
